so to get rid of apktools all the errors i tried my best....maybe there can be some errors left

so first of all remove inbuilt apktool using

command :- apt-get remove apktool && apt-get autoremove 

now we will install openjdk-11-jdk and openjdk-17-jdk packages

command :- apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk openjdk-17-jdk


now we will install official apktool

got to this below site and follow all the steps

site :- https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/install/

download apktool wrapper using wget commamd

command :- wge https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool/master/scripts/linux/apktool

now download apktool.jar file 

command :- wget https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/apktool_2.5.0.jar

rename it to apktool.jar

command :- mv apktool_2.5.0.jar apktool.jar

now give the executable permission

command :- chmod +x apktool apktool.jar

now move this two files into /usr/bin folder

command :- mv apktool /usr/bin/ && mv apktool.jar /usr/bin/

now it's to download aapt binaries and android-framework-res

command :- apt-get install aapt android-framework-res

now we are ready to role

but first of all we need to set our framework apk...so for that

command :- apktool if /usr/share/android-framework-res/framework-res.apk

Now, try our new apktool but with new aapt2 binaries...i will show u while building apk

command :- apktool d {apkname}

now do your modification and ready to build

command :- apktool b {apk_foldername} -a /usr/bin/aapt2


hoorayyyy!!!!!!!......working like a charm (NOTE :- sometimes it won't work because of large apk and some apktool errors(dev side))

so why i didn't use inbuild apktools aapt binaries.....because it is not compatible with our device

that's why i used our own aapt2 binaries.....
