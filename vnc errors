so after doing the full upgrade of nethunter i encountered a vnc server problem

so to fix these issues

first of all we will delete .vnc directory and delete all the content of tmp directory

if you are creating root users vnc server copy and paste below command

code :- rm -rf /root/.vnc && rm -rf /tmp/* && rm -rf /tmp/.*

if you are creating kali users vnc server copy and paste below command

rm -rf /kali/.vnc && rm -rf /tmp/* && rm -rf /tmp/.*

just copy and paste this command into terminal to atart new vncserver

code :- vncserver

now provide password and done

connect to vnc and enjoy

to stop vnc server you can just go to nethunter app >> kex manager

hit the stop button

now you can again start vncserver from nethunter app....so no need to use vncserver command all the time
