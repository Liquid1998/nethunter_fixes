whenever u start beef from menu it won't start. It will just show you that you need to change your password.

you simply enter the password and after that it starts beef.but it won't start and show you this 

http://localhost:3000 unable to connect

so, here is the fix

you simply need to go to the directory of beef which is located under /usr/share

so just cd into beef directory using below code

code :- cd /usr/share/beef-xss

now simply run beef binary using code

code :- ./beef

Now this problem is solved.but after that another problem u will encounter and that is

not able to hook victim because of $LANG error which u can see after starting beef

so to solve this issue you just have to copy and paste this three lines into your .bashrc or .zshrc whatever the shell you are running

code :-

        export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
        export LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8
        export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
       
NOW, refresh your source or simply reopen the terminal

and again run beef from directory

problem solved
